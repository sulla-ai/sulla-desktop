# Creating Your First n8n Workflow

In Sulla, your AI executive assistant is built to create automations and workflows for you.

Your main job is to clearly describe what you want.

## Core idea

You do not need to manually build every step first.

Start by instructing your AI assistant with:

- What outcome you want
- What data it should collect
- How often it should run
- Where results should be delivered

The clearer your request, the better the generated workflow.

## How to ask for a workflow

Use a prompt format like this:

1. **Goal:** What should this automation accomplish?
2. **Inputs/Sources:** Where should it pull data from?
3. **Schedule:** How often should it run (daily, hourly, weekdays, etc.)?
4. **Output format:** Summary, bullet points, full report, etc.
5. **Delivery method:** Email, Slack, or another connected integration.

## Starter workflow recommendation: Daily news brief

A great first workflow is a news/trend brief.

Example request to your assistant:

"Create a daily workflow that collects key trends in my industry, summarizes top updates, and sends me a short brief every morning at 8:00 AM by email."

You can also route delivery to Slack (or another integration) if you prefer.

## Review and revise after generation

After the assistant creates the workflow:

1. Open it in the Automation/Workflow system.
2. Review triggers, steps, and output format.
3. Ask the assistant to revise anything you want changed.

You can also manually edit workflow steps when needed.

## Example revision prompts

- "Change this to run only Monday to Friday."
- "Send results to Slack instead of email."
- "Reduce output to 5 bullet points max."
- "Add one section for urgent/high-impact updates only."

## Best practices

- Start small with one clear workflow.
- Keep instructions specific.
- Iterate in small revisions instead of large rewrites.
- Use connected integrations so delivery is automatic.
