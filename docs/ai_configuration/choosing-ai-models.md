# Choosing AI Models

Choosing the right model has a direct impact on how smart, autonomous, and reliable your AI assistant feels.

In general: **smarter models produce better planning, better decisions, and better tool use**.

## Quick recommendation

If you want the best balance for most users:

- Start with **Grok** (recommended default)
- Use **Op.46** or **Sonnet 4.6** when you want maximum autonomy and intelligence

## Why model choice matters

The model controls how well your agent can:

- Understand complex tasks
- Plan multi-step actions
- Recover from mistakes
- Use tools and integrations effectively
- Keep context over longer workflows

If you pick a weaker model, your assistant may feel less capable and require more manual guidance.

## Model comparison (practical)

### Grok (recommended)

**Benefits**

- Strong quality for day-to-day agent tasks
- Good speed/cost profile
- Great default choice for most users

**Tradeoffs**

- For the most demanding reasoning tasks, you may still prefer a top-tier max-intelligence model

### Op.46

**Benefits**

- Excellent reasoning and planning depth
- Strong autonomy for complex workflows
- Very capable for high-stakes agent decisions

**Tradeoffs**

- Usually higher cost than lighter options
- Can be slower on some workloads

### Sonnet 4.6

**Benefits**

- Very strong intelligence and instruction following
- Great for advanced agent workflows
- Strong balance of reliability and capability

**Tradeoffs**

- Typically costs more than budget-tier models

## Common questions

### Which model should I choose first?

Use **Grok** first. It is the recommended starting point for most Sulla setups.

### What if I want the smartest possible agent behavior?

Use **Op.46** or **Sonnet 4.6**. These are currently top choices when you want maximum autonomy and intelligence.

### Does a smarter model really make a difference?

Yes. Smarter models make the assistant feel more capable because they reason better, plan better, and execute complex tasks with less hand-holding.

### Should I use a local model instead?

Only if you are an advanced user with a high-end machine. Most users will get better quality and easier setup using remote models.

## Recommended rollout strategy

1. Start with **Grok** as your default model.
2. Test your core workflows.
3. If you need more intelligence/autonomy, move to **Op.46** or **Sonnet 4.6**.
4. Keep one model as your stable default and only switch when there is a clear quality gain.
