# Updating to Latest Version

Sulla Desktop includes a built-in self-updater so you can stay current with the latest fixes and features.

## Auto-updater behavior

- Auto updates are **enabled by default**.
- When a new version is available, Sulla will notify you in-app.
- You can click the update/install action in the notification to self-update.

## Configure update preferences

You can control update behavior in:

- **Preferences > Updates**

From there, you can:

- Enable or disable automatic update checks
- Keep auto updates enabled (recommended)

## Recommended setting

Keep auto updates enabled so you are notified quickly when new releases are available.

## Typical update flow

1. A new version is published.
2. Sulla checks for updates (if auto updates are enabled).
3. You receive an in-app update notification.
4. Click install/update.
5. Sulla applies the update and restarts if required.

## Under the hood

Sulla Desktop update delivery is based on the Electron auto-update flow used in the Rancher Desktop foundation.

This provides a standard desktop experience for checking, notifying, downloading, and applying updates.

## If updates are disabled

If you disabled update checks, re-enable them in Preferences to resume update notifications.

You can also install the latest version manually from:
