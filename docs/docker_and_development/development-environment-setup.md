# Development Environment Setup

Sulla Desktop can replace your Docker Desktop workflow for day-to-day development operations.

## Container management in the dashboard

Inside Sulla, you can open the Docker dashboard and manage containers normally, including:

- Viewing running/stopped containers
- Starting and stopping services
- Reviewing container status
- Monitoring development workloads

## AI assistant container access

Your AI executive assistant can also work directly with containers by:

- Managing container lifecycle actions
- Debugging container issues
- Logging into containers
- Executing commands inside containers

## Shared environment advantage

Containers run in the same environment your AI executive assistant operates in.

This makes it easier to do fast development loops where your assistant can:

- Test changes
- Debug issues
- Validate fixes in-container

This is especially useful for rapid vibe-coding and iterative debugging workflows.
