# Docker Desktop Integration

This page answers common questions about Docker Desktop integration in Sulla Desktop.

## Quick answer

Sulla is designed to give you a Docker-style development workflow directly inside Sulla Desktop, with AI-assisted container operations.

## Common questions

### Do I still manage containers normally?

Yes. You can manage containers in the Docker dashboard area inside Sulla, including viewing, starting, stopping, and monitoring containers.

### Can my AI assistant work with containers too?

Yes. Your AI executive assistant can:

- Inspect container-related issues
- Help debug containerized apps
- Execute commands in container contexts
- Assist with iterative fix-and-test loops

### Is this useful for development workflows?

Yes. It is especially useful when building and debugging quickly, because container operations and AI assistance are part of the same environment.

### Where should I start if I am setting this up for the first time?

1. Open the Docker/dashboard section in Sulla.
2. Verify your containers are running.
3. Ask Sulla to validate service health and logs.
4. Use AI-assisted debugging when an app/container fails.

### What issues do users usually run into?

Typical issues include:

- Container not starting
- Port conflicts
- Missing environment variables
- Service dependency order problems

When these happen, ask Sulla to inspect and debug first, then apply manual changes if needed.

## Best practice

Treat Sulla as your primary control plane for development containers and AI-assisted debugging.
