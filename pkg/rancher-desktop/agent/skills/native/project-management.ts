## Overview
A **project** is any workspace folder that contains a \`PROJECT.md\` file. That file is the PRD (project resource document) — the single source of truth. Projects live under \`~/sulla/projects/\` by default.

**One size does not fit all.** A small task gets a small PRD. A large task gets a comprehensive PRD. Choose the right template tier based on complexity.

## Discovery Tools
- **search_projects** — Search by name, description, status, or tags
- **load_project** — Load the full PROJECT.md content for a project

## How to Create a Project
1. Call \`create_workspace("my-project-name")\` — this creates the folder and returns its absolute path.
2. Write a \`PROJECT.md\` file in that folder using your filesystem tools. This is what makes the folder a project.
3. Optionally create a \`README.md\` for getting-started / structure overview.
4. Add the project to \`ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md\` in the **root** of the projects directory (see below).

Use the appropriate PRD template tier below based on task complexity.

## How to Edit a Project
Read and write the \`PROJECT.md\` file directly with your filesystem tools. No special tools needed — just edit the file.

## ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md
There is exactly **one** \`ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md\` file and it lives in the **root of the projects directory** — NOT inside any individual project folder. This file is the master list of all projects currently in-flight.

- Add a project here when it is created and active.
- Remove a project when the human says it is completed, archived, or no longer relevant.
- When the human reprioritizes — e.g., "focus on X, drop Y" — update this file to reflect the new priorities.
- This file does NOT exist inside individual project folders. Each project folder only has \`PROJECT.md\` (and optionally \`README.md\`).

## Project Lifecycle

### 1. Discovery
Always start by searching for existing projects:
\`\`\`
search_projects("relevant keywords")
\`\`\`

### 2. Size Assessment
Before creating a PRD, classify the task:
- **Small** — Single-step or trivial task (a quick config change, a bug fix, a one-liner). Use the Minimal PRD.
- **Medium** — Multi-step task with clear scope (a feature, a script, a single integration). Use the Standard PRD.
- **Large** — Complex multi-system project (multiple integrations, research, architecture decisions, credentials, templates). Use the Full PRD.

### 3. Creation
Call \`create_workspace\` then write the PROJECT.md with the appropriately sized template (see below). Add the project to ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md.

### 4. Iteration
Edit the PROJECT.md directly — update specific sections as work progresses.

### 5. Completion
Update the \`status\` field in the frontmatter to "completed" or "archived". Remove the project from ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md.

# Skill: Automation Workflow (n8n) Project

**Ultimate Project Goal**: Automatically qualify every new Typeform lead submission, create a Linear ticket for high-quality leads, add them to the correct Mailchimp audience, and notify the responsible sales rep in Slack with a personalized message.

**Owner**: Jonathon Byrdziak
**Start Date**: 2026-02-23

**User Stories**
- As a sales rep, I want qualified leads automatically created in Linear so I don't miss hot prospects.
- As a marketing manager, I want new leads added to the right Mailchimp list for nurturing.
- As a sales lead, I want to be notified instantly in Slack when a good lead comes in with all key details.

**Checklist of Completed Items**
None documented in current context or memory.

**Must Haves**
- Typeform webhook trigger on new submission
- Qualification logic based on company size and budget
- Create Linear ticket for qualified leads
- Add lead to correct Mailchimp audience
- Send personalized Slack message to the assigned sales rep
- Full logging of every decision

**Should Haves**
- Score lead on a 1-10 scale
- Different Mailchimp lists based on lead quality
- Attach form responses to Linear ticket

**Nice-to-Haves**
- AI-generated personalized first message to the lead
- Auto-assign sales rep based on region
- Daily lead digest summary

**What Has Been Tried and Didn't Work**
None documented in current context or memory.

## Requirements
- **Trigger type**: Typeform webhook (new submission)
- **Error handling**: If any integration fails, log the full error, send alert to #sales-alerts Slack channel, and do not create partial records. Retry up to 3 times.

## Template Research
- Categories explored: Typeform, Lead Qualification, Linear, Mailchimp, Slack
- Search queries used: "typeform lead qualification linear mailchimp n8n", "typeform to linear ticket n8n"
- Top candidates:
  - Template ID 14567: "Typeform to Linear Ticket" (fit 8/10 — good ticket creation but no Mailchimp)
  - Template ID 13289: "Typeform Lead Router" (fit 9/10 — excellent qualification and routing logic)
- Selected template: Template ID 13289 ("Typeform Lead Router")
- Rationale: This template already handles Typeform webhook, scoring logic, and routing. We only need to add Mailchimp subscription and Slack notification nodes.

## Credential Resolution
| Integration   | Required | Status     | Notes / Action Needed                  |
|---------------|----------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Typeform      | Yes      | Ready      | Webhook already configured             |
| Linear        | Yes      | Ready      | API key ready                          |
| Mailchimp     | Yes      | Ready      | API key ready                          |
| Slack         | Yes      | Ready      | Bot token ready                        |

## Workflow Details
- **Workflow name**: workflow-typeform-lead-qualification
- **High-level node flow**: Typeform Webhook → Qualify Lead → Conditional Router → Create Linear Ticket → Subscribe to Mailchimp → Send Slack Notification
- **Nodes**: 8 | **Connections**: 10 (based on selected template + 2 added nodes)

## README.md Conventions
Optionally create a README.md alongside PROJECT.md. It should contain:
- Project title and description (pulled from PROJECT.md)
- Getting Started section
- Project Structure section
- Development section

## Best Practices
1. **Always search first** — avoid duplicate projects
2. **Use kebab-case slugs** — e.g., \`daily-intelligence-monitor\`
3. **Match PRD size to task complexity** — don't over-document a bug fix, don't under-document a multi-system integration
4. **Keep PROJECT.md as the single source of truth** — all project details live here
5. **Edit PROJECT.md directly** — just read and write the file with your filesystem tools
6. **Set status accurately** — active, paused, completed, or archived
7. **Include workspace_path** — so you can locate the project folder
8. **Tag consistently** — always include "project" plus relevant domain tags
