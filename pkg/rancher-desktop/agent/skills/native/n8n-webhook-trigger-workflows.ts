# Skill Manifest: n8n Webhook Trigger Workflows

**Triggers**: Human says "trigger workflow", "webhook workflow", "return webhook response", "create webhook endpoint", "execute workflow by webhook", "fix webhook response".

## Core Rule
For webhook workflows that must return a response body, use:
- Webhook node with \`responseMode: "responseNode"\`
- A \`Respond to Webhook\` node in the executed path

Do **not** rely on \`responseMode: "lastNode"\` for payload responses. In current n8n behavior this can return \`{}\` even when upstream nodes produced data.

## Architecture Check (Mandatory)
Every time creating/updating a webhook workflow, run this check before activation:

1. Detect webhook trigger nodes.
2. Read each webhook node's \`responseMode\`.
3. Validate mode/node compatibility:
   - If \`responseMode = "responseNode"\`: must have a reachable \`Respond to Webhook\` node.
   - If \`responseMode = "lastNode"\` with Set/transform-style response shaping: treat as unsafe.
4. If unsafe, repair to explicit architecture:
   - Switch webhook to \`responseMode: "responseNode"\`
   - Add/fix \`Respond to Webhook\` node wired in the main execution path.

## Required Execution Pattern

### 1) Build or update workflow
- Create/update webhook workflow structure.
- Ensure explicit response architecture is present.

### 2) Activate workflow
- Activate only after architecture validation passes.

### 3) Auto-test endpoint immediately
- Call the webhook endpoint with representative payload.
- Capture HTTP status + response body.

### 4) If endpoint result is wrong, inspect execution data
- Pull latest execution(s) for the workflow.
- Compare:
  - Did nodes execute successfully?
  - What did endpoint return?
- If nodes executed but HTTP response is empty/missing fields, classify as response wiring/config mismatch.

### 5) Report actionable diagnosis
Return a compact summary:
- Architecture status (valid/invalid)
- Endpoint test status (pass/fail)
- Execution evidence (node path + response mismatch notes)
- Exact remediation applied or required

## Atomic Workflow Contract
Treat webhook creation/update as an atomic operation:
1. Build node graph
2. Validate response architecture
3. Auto-fix if needed
4. Activate
5. Endpoint smoke test
6. Execution-vs-response verification on failure

Do not stop after only node creation. A webhook workflow is not complete until response behavior is verified.

## Suggested Tool Sequence
Use available n8n tools in this order:
1. \`create_workflow\` / \`update_workflow\` (or \`patch_workflow\`)
2. \`get_workflow\` / \`get_workflow_node_list\` to validate topology
3. \`activate_workflow\`
4. \`get_workflow_webhook_url\` and endpoint test
5. \`diagnose_webhook\` for execution + registration + endpoint triage when tests fail

## Failure Signatures
- **Symptom:** HTTP 200 with \`{}\` but workflow appears to run.
  - **Likely cause:** lastNode mode mismatch.
  - **Fix:** switch to responseNode + explicit Respond to Webhook.

- **Symptom:** Endpoint times out / hangs.
  - **Likely cause:** Respond to Webhook node not executed in active path.
  - **Fix:** correct routing/conditions so response node always runs for expected path.

- **Symptom:** Endpoint 404/registration errors.
  - **Likely cause:** webhook not registered/active.
  - **Fix:** reactivate and verify registration state.

## Clean Webhook Path Registration

**Problem:** Webhooks register with unwanted \`{workflowId}/webhook/\` prefix instead of a clean path.

**Root Cause:** Missing \`webhookId\` property on the webhook node definition.

**Permanent Fix:** Add \`webhookId\` field to the webhook node with your desired clean path. It **must match** the \`path\` parameter.

\`\`\`json
{
  "id": "webhook-node",
  "name": "Webhook",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook",
  "typeVersion": 2,
  "position": [240, 300],
  "webhookId": "your-clean-path",
  "parameters": {
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "path": "your-clean-path",
    "responseMode": "responseNode",
    "options": {}
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Result:** Webhook registers at \`/webhook/your-clean-path\` instead of \`/webhook/{workflowId}/webhook/your-clean-path\`.

### Failure Signature
- **Symptom:** Webhook URL contains \`{workflowId}/webhook/\` prefix, making it ugly or breaking integrations expecting a clean path.
  - **Likely cause:** \`webhookId\` not set on the node definition (only \`path\` in parameters).
  - **Fix:** Add \`webhookId\` at the node level matching the \`parameters.path\` value.

## Execute Workflow Node Pattern (System-Wide)

**Problem:** Execute Workflow node fails with "Workflow does not exist" error.

**Root Cause:** Called workflows must be ACTIVE (n8n auto-publishes on activation) and use the correct trigger node type.

### Caller workflow (the one with Execute Workflow node)
- Use standard webhook trigger or any trigger type
- Execute Workflow node can have any settings (\`waitForExecution: true\` recommended for sync)

### Called workflow (the one being executed)
- **Must** use \`n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger\` node type (NOT a webhook trigger)
- **Must** be ACTIVE (n8n auto-publishes on activation)
- The Execute Workflow Trigger node has no configuration — it is just a receiver

### Example called workflow structure
\`\`\`json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "trigger-node",
      "name": "Execute Workflow Trigger",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [240, 300],
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "process-node",
      "name": "Your Logic Here",
      "type": "...",
      "position": [440, 300],
      "parameters": {}
    }
  ],
  "connections": {
    "Execute Workflow Trigger": {
      "main": [[{"node": "Your Logic Here", "type": "main", "index": 0}]]
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Failure Signature
- **Symptom:** Execute Workflow node returns "Workflow does not exist"
  - **Likely cause:** Called workflow uses wrong trigger type (e.g. webhook instead of executeWorkflowTrigger) or is not active.
  - **Fix:** Change called workflow trigger to \`n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger\` and activate it.

## Definition of Done
A webhook-trigger workflow is done only when all are true:
- Webhook response architecture validated
- Workflow active
- Endpoint returns expected payload for test input
- Execution evidence aligns with HTTP response
