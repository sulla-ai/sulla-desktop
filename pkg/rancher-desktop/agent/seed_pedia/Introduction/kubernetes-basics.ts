## Why Kubernetes

A local Kubernetes cluster enables repeatable dev/test environments and orchestration of multi-component workloads.

## Core concepts

- Cluster, nodes
- Namespaces
- Deployments, pods, services
- ConfigMaps and Secrets

## Common tasks

- Check cluster health
- View workloads
- Inspect logs/events
- Apply manifests and rollouts

## What makes this special

Kubernetes enables durable, reproducible environments that an agent can inspect and manage with strong primitives.
