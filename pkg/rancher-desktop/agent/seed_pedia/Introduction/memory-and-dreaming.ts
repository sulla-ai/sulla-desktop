## Memory in Sulla

Memory is one of the core capabilities that makes Sulla powerful, productive, organized, and informative. This memory layer is stored in the very capable Neo4j knowledge graph, which can store massive amounts of information and be searched very quickly by the language model. The memory can also be updated and edited by the user, allowing for collaborative knowledge building.

## Knowledge Graph Storage

- **Neo4j Database**: Durable knowledge storage enabling future interactions to benefit from past learning
- **Massive Capacity**: Handles enormous volumes of information efficiently
- **Rapid Search**: Language models can quickly retrieve relevant knowledge
- **User Editing**: Direct user modifications and updates to the knowledge base

## KnowledgeBase vs Other Memory

- **KnowledgeBase**: Curated, document-style articles with structured content
- **Other Memory**: Summaries, entities, and recall-oriented data for quick access
- **Integration**: Both types work together to provide comprehensive memory capabilities

## Memory Associations

The relationships between articles are very powerful for the language model to create associations between different chunks of information. Associations between memories is exactly how human minds work, and now the AI agent Sulla can use this memory in the same way, building connections that enable deeper understanding and more intelligent responses.

## The Dreaming Process

Dreaming is something that the AI agent does at night after spending a lot of time collecting data. During dreaming, Sulla takes the time to think over the data in the memory graph, creating new associations between data points and eliminating outdated or irrelevant connections. It's the time to go over all the information and decide what is important and what is not important.

## Planning vs Execution

Dreaming provides dedicated time for planning projects and organizing thoughts, distinct from the execution phase:

- **Planning Phase**: Organizing information, identifying priorities, mapping out strategies
- **Execution Phase**: Actually carrying out the planned actions and tasks
- **Balance**: Dreaming ensures sufficient planning before action, improving outcomes

## Optimal Processing Conditions

Dreaming often occurs under ideal processing conditions:

- **Offline State**: Agent may not be connected to the internet to focus internally
- **Resource Availability**: CPUs not being used by other systems, allowing full power for internal processing
- **Dedicated Time**: Focused period for knowledge graph development and consolidation

## Output of Dreaming

What comes out of dreaming is not hallucination but hardened and organized information based on fact or reasoned presumption. It's the time when the agent uses logic to begin developing their memory, producing imaginative ideas, phenomenal plans, and results engineered for success.

## Intelligence Through Imagination

A key form of intelligence is one's ability to think of different ways to use a tool or element - this is imagination. When an AI agent like Sulla wants to become more intelligent and act more intelligently, they use their imagination and dreaming ability to:

- **Generate New Ideas**: Come up with innovative approaches and solutions
- **Broad Brainstorming**: Think big and wide, exploring all possibilities
- **Gap Filling**: Use information to fill in missing pieces of understanding
- **Concrete Planning**: Decide on the most effective plans and map them out systematically

## What Gets Written

- Articles (schema v1) stored in Neo4j knowledge graph with full relationship mapping
- Metadata fields (title, tags, dates) used for navigation, sorting, and association building
- Association data linking related concepts, memories, and knowledge chunks
- Organized information emerging from the dreaming process for enhanced intelligence

This memory and dreaming system enables Sulla to continuously learn, organize knowledge, and develop increasingly sophisticated intelligence through structured imagination and logical processing.`;
