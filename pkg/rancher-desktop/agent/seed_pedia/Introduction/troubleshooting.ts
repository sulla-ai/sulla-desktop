## If the agent seems stuck

- Check whether a tool call is still running.
- Inspect the most recent tool output.
- Retry with a smaller, safer step.

## Common areas

- Docker not running
- Kubernetes cluster not healthy
- Model not available / slow

## Recovery mindset

Prefer reversible changes and always confirm the system state before continuing.
