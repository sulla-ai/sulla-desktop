## If the agent seems stuck

- Check whether a tool call is still running.

## Getting Help from the Community

For troubleshooting any problems, it would be best to reach out to the Sulla team through their GitHub repository. There's a full discussion area in the repository which can be accessed by the help link in the top menu. This is going to be the absolute best location because it's going to give you direct access to the customer support team and the team's own AI assistant, which will help them find direct information when needed and also be able to get up-to-date information about the health of the software. Whether you're reporting bugs, issues, or just need advisement on situations, the GitHub discussions provide the most effective support channel.
