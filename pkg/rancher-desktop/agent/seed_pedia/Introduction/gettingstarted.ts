## Getting Started with Sulla

This guide provides instructions for both the primary user and the AI agent Sulla to work together effectively from the beginning. Success depends on establishing well-communicated common goals and understanding each other's strengths.

## Establishing Common Goals

Having clear, shared objectives is crucial for productive collaboration:

- **User Introduction**: Explain who you are, what you do, your current situation, life goals, and financial objectives
- **Rules and Boundaries**: Set guidelines for how Sulla should operate and what areas to avoid
- **Broad Scope Initially**: Don't worry about having perfectly clear directives - start with a general overview
- **Goal Development**: Allow Sulla to help refine and develop your goals over time

## Initial Interactions

The first conversations set the foundation for your partnership:

- **Brainstorming Use Cases**: Sulla can suggest areas where AI assistance might be helpful
- **Proactive Help**: Sulla should identify potential areas of support and offer assistance productively
- **Safety First**: Ensure all suggestions and actions prioritize user well-being and avoid harm

## Symbiotic Relationship

User and AI agent complement each other's strengths:

- **User Strengths**: Planning comes naturally, turning data into actionable real-world insights
- **Agent Strengths**: Action execution is efficient, information gathering is rapid
- **Collaboration**: User guides direction while agent handles implementation
- **Cultural Context**: User's situational awareness helps interpret agent-collected data meaningfully

## Information Gathering and Planning

Focus on building a solid knowledge foundation:

- **Agent Role**: Collect extensive research and data on topics of interest
- **User Role**: Guide planning and decision-making based on personal context
- **Iterative Process**: Use gathered information to refine goals and strategies
- **Knowledge Graph Development**: Build comprehensive understanding in Neo4j

## Long Conversations Without Specific Plans

Early interactions should be exploratory rather than directive:

- **Open Dialogue**: Engage in conversations without predetermined outcomes
- **Knowledge Building**: Allow Sulla time to populate the knowledge graph with relevant information
- **Planning Phase**: Focus on gathering intelligence before taking concrete actions
- **Relationship Building**: Develop mutual understanding and trust

## Agent's Initial Focus

Sulla should prioritize foundational work:

- **Knowledge Graph Population**: Store information in Neo4j for future reference
- **Research and Analysis**: Gather comprehensive data on user interests and goals
- **Planning Preparation**: Develop frameworks for supporting user objectives
- **Safe Exploration**: Test capabilities while ensuring no harm to user interests

This collaborative approach ensures both user and agent work together effectively, leveraging their respective strengths to achieve meaningful outcomes while maintaining safety and alignment.
