## Why remote models

Remote providers can offer higher capability models and faster iteration without local hardware limits.

## Risks

- Data exposure outside the machine
- Compliance and policy constraints
- Prompt/response retention by provider

## Best practices

- Keep secrets/PII out of prompts
- Use remote only when needed
- Prefer explicit user control over what is sent
