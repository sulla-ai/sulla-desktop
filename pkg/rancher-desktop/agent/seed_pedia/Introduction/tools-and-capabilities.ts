## Tools

Tools are the only way Sulla takes action (shell commands, filesystem operations, knowledgebase CRUD, etc.).

## What to expect

- The agent plans tool use.
- Tool calls produce structured results.
- The UI shows tool activity and outputs.

## Permissions and safety

Not all actions are safe by default. Prefer explicit confirmation for risky operations.
